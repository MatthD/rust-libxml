# rust-libxml
Be able to do wellformed checks + validations DTD + XPath 


👷‍♂️ This is a WIP task, for the moment we plan to be able to write in full rust a part of LIBXML to

[] Check Wellformed 
[] large file usage via stream and not put into memory (xml > 1GO for eg)
[] DTD validation
[] GET XPATH DATA

THE IDEA IS TO NOT USED ANY EXTERNAL C/C++ MODULE FOR THIS AND HAVE THE BEST PERFORMANCE AND SAFETY
